# Upgrading Search for Liferay 7.3

- Backing up your indexes
- Installing Elasticsearch 7 
- Connecting Liferay to Elasticsearch
- Re-indexing the Workflow Metrics, Company, and System indexes from their dedicated user interfaces
- Restoring the search tuning indexes from the backed up version

## Search Upgrade Overview

The list above just scratches the surface of the search upgrade picture: it doesn't cover any more complicated scenarios (like if you have Liferay Enterprise Search modules to upgrade as well). Find the scenario that matches your Liferay version, LES version (if using LES), and your current search engine stack. Use the *Upgrade Steps* column to guide the upgrade.

## Common Upgrade Steps

```important::
   `Back up the search indexes <./backing-up-elasticsearch.md>`__ before proceeding with these steps.
```

Upgrade scenarios for systems not including LES apps will include these steps:

1. [Connect Liferay to Elasticsearch 7.](../connecting-to-elasticsearch.md)

1. [Configure security.](../securing-elasticsearch.md)

1. [Upgrade Liferay.](../../../../installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics/upgrade-overview.md)

1. [Re-index the search and spell check indexes.](../../../../installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics/post-upgrade-considerations.md)

1. [Re-index the Workflow Metrics indexes.](../../../../process-automation/workflow/user-guide/workflow-metrics-reports.md#re-indexing-workflow-metrics)

1. Test the search experience in the upgraded system to ensure everything is working as expected.

## LES Upgrade Steps

```important::
   `Back up the search indexes <./backing-up-elasticsearch.md>`__ before proceeding with these steps.
```

Systems using LES apps will use these steps to upgrade:

1. Connect Liferay to Elasticsearch 7.

1. Configure security.

1. Install Kibana 7 if you are currently using Kibana and Monitoring.

1. Install and deploy LES Monitoring if you are currently using Kibana and Elasticsearch Monitoring/X-Pack Monitoring.

1. Configure the Elasticsearch Monitoring connector if you are using LES Monitoring or the Connector to X-Pack Monitoring.

1. [Upgrade Liferay.](../../../../installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics/upgrade-overview.md)

1. Re-index the search and spell check indexes.

1. Re-index the workflow metrics indexes.

## Test the Upgraded Search Experience

Manually test the upgraded search experience to ensure the features you depend on work as expected. If something is not working or behaving differently than you expect, review [Liferay's Breaking Changes](./../../../../liferay-internals/reference/7-3-breaking-changes.md).

## LES Applications Renamed

> **LES Subscribers**

Though not explicitly linked to the Liferay CE/DXP 7.3 release, these apps were renamed to better reflect their functionality and to emphasize their identity as LES apps:

| Functionality | Old App Name | New App Name | 7.2 Configuration File | 7.3 Configuration File |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |------------ | ------------ |
| Monitoring the Elasticsearch cluster | Liferay Connector to X-Pack Monitoring [Elastic Stack 6.x] | Liferay Enterprise Search Monitoring | `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.xpack.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.XPackMonitoringConfiguration.config` | |
| Securing the Elasticsearch cluster | Liferay Connector to X-Pack Security [Elastic Stack 6.x] | Liferay Enterprise Search Security |
| Using machine learning to optimize the search algorithm | Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch Learning to Rank | Liferay Enterprise Search Learning to Rank |
| Replicating indexes across remote data centers | NA (new app) | Liferay Enterprise Search Cross-Cluster Replication |

For Liferay 7.2 widget and configuration names were unchanged. In Liferay 7.3 the monitoring widget and the configurations were renamed.

It has the following upgrade impacts:
1. The name of the widget has changed to just ***Elasticsearch Monitoring***. This is taken care of during the startup by a module upgrade step when _Liferay Enterprise Search Monitoring_ for DXP 7.3 is deployed, doesn't require actions from admins.
1. The name of configuration file has changed from `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.xpack.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.XPackMonitoringConfiguration.config` to **`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.MonitoringConfiguration`**. (The properties are the same as before.). This is taken care of at startup by a module upgrade step, doesn't require actions from admins.
1. The Kibana base path that the monitoring widget is using has changed. **Administrators will have to change** this in `kibana.yml`:

from

```yaml
server.basePath: "/o/portal-search-elasticsearch-xpack-monitoring/xpack-monitoring-proxy"
```

to

```yaml
server.basePath: "/o/portal-search-elasticsearch-monitoring/monitoring-proxy"
```
The new names are as follows:

|Old App Name|New App Name|Upgrade Action|
|:--:|:--:|
| Liferay Connector to X-Pack Security [Elastic Stack 6.x] | Liferay Enterprise Search Security | No action required, this app is not available for DXP 7.3, features are integrated into the Elasticsearch 7 connector bundled with DXP 7.3. |
| Liferay Connector to X-Pack Monitoring [Elastic Stack 6.x] |Liferay Enterprise Search Monitoring | See above |
| Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch Learning to Rank | Liferay Enterprise Search Learning to Rank | No action required |
Liferay 7.3 supports only Elasticsearch 7.9.0+ via the out-of-the-box Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch. The matrix of pre-upgrade stacks you are migrating from is more numerous, and it's important to understand the high-level steps required to safely navigate from your existing stack to the Liferay 7.3 stack.  The most basic scenario includes

## What's Next 

Now that you know your upgrade path, start upgrading to use Liferay 7.3 with the latest [Elasticsearch](./upgrading-to-elasticsearch-7.md) (recommended) or [Solr](../../solr.rst) (now deprecated as of Liferay 7.3) search engine.
